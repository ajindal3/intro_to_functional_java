# A simple workshop to introduce some of the functional aspects of Java 8.

The code in the workshop has the following dependencies:

- An internet connection (as we'll need to pull down some libraries).
- IntelliJ IDEA IDE (CE will do).
- Gradle.

The workshop will introduce the following concepts:
 
- Predicates.
- Lambdas and using them in mapping.
- Reduction.
