- Don't expose your innards:
-- There are a lot of area calculations going on.
-- LoadingBayRepository has lots of multi-calls.

- Proper OO modelling:
-- LoadingBayRepository contains two lists,
   one to represent the total area available,
   and the other to represent the remaining space.
   Encapsulate these into a single list of LoadingBay objects.
